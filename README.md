## Disclaimer

This repo is a personal project I started on my React Native learning path.
It is not meant to release a production-ready application (at least not yet), but instead for educational purpose.

Here the changes I've planned (there's no change on the backend side).

- [x] Move some features in dedicated directories.
- [x] Convert class components into functional components.
- [x] Upgrade navigation to v5
- [x] Improve translations
- [x] Replace the redux-form package (form data should not be stored in global state)
- [ ] Improve calls to the API (by caching for example)
- [ ] Upgrade or remove deprecated packages
- [ ] Optimize data access in redux store  with memoization
- [ ] Optimize data access in redux store  with normalization (use [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr))
- [ ] Add tests
